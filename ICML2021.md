[Integer Programming for Causal Structure Learning in the Presence of Latent Variables](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/chen21c.html)

**ADMG(ancestral acyclic directed mixed graphs)** It is known that DAG models are not closed under marginalization. This implies that DAGs cannot be used to model structures involving latent variables which are the most common cases in practice.

[Estimating Identifiable Causal Effects on Markov Equivalence Class through Double Machine Learning](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/jung21b.html)

**Partial ancestral graph (PAG)**  Most of this literature assumes that the underlying causal graph is completely specified. However, only observational data is
available in most practical settings, which means that one can learn at most a Markov equivalence class (MEC) of the underlying causal graph. In this paper, we study the problem of causal estimation from a MEC represented by a partial ancestral graph (PAG), which is learnable from observational data.

[Generative Causal Explanations for Graph Neural Networks](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/lin21d.html)

To the best of our knowledge, while the notion of causality has been used for interpretable machine learning on images or texts, this is the first effort from a causal perspective to explain graph neural networks

[Domain Generalization using Causal Matching](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/mahajan21b.html)

A popular class of methods aim to learn representations that are independent of domain conditional on class. We formalize this observation through a structural causal model and show the importance of modeling within-class variations for generalization.
